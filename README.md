# Health_Checkup_Recommendation_System
This project aims to utilize machine learning to analyze common symptoms exhibited by individuals. By considering well-known symptoms, the system will predict whether the person is at risk of developing
general health issues. Based on these predictions, the system will provide recommendations on whether the individual should consider consulting a doctor. This approach offers a comprehensive assessment of general health conditions, assisting users in making informed decisions about seeking medical advice.

Now, We are trying to do a real time data analysis on this model where we will take the real time data and predict whether the people using the application will be in need to visit the Doctor or not... and will add every report in the Research paper!
